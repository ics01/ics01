- 👋 Hi, I’m @ics01
- 👀 I’m interested in windev/webdev development (sorry for the "true geeks" ! ;=)), business management (as we develop an ERP)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning spanish to translate our ERP.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate currently, but collaborations are open on Gestan (our ERP). Theoretically, it's possible to share code on Git, not yet tested !
- 📫 How to reach me : see www.ics-informatique.com or www.gestan.fr
